# Data-Scrapping-Experimental
Simple Experimental self project to kill time...

* This project displays the Working of Beautiful Soup to Scrape the Internet and displayed using GraphAI.

* I have scrapped IMDB to get names of top 100 movies.

* This data has properties like:  Movie Name, Year, Actors(as a list), Directors, Writers and Rating.

* Using py2neo a connection between Python and Neo4J is completed and this data is then fed into Neo4J server.

* This Graph Database is then used to display the contents and visualise different aspects.

* For Instance, we can see how two actors are related via a common director, movie or writer.

* Neo4J common and complex querries can be learned and observed.
